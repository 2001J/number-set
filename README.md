# number-set
This project involves implementing a set type specifically for integers. 
Key functionalities include insertion, removal, checking if the set is empty, checking if it contains an element, retrieving a random element without removal, counting the number of even numbers in the set, and printing the set.
 It's suggested to store and update the count of even numbers whenever the set changes.
 The set should ensure each element is stored only once.
